# Containers for Kubeflow

Containers to be used with Kubeflow for Data Science.

## Introduction

Our Container images are based on the community driven [jupyter/docker-stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks). This enables us to focus only on the additional toolsets that we require to enable our data scientists.

Our GPU images are based on the work of [iot-salzburg/gpu-jupyter](https://github.com/iot-salzburg/gpu-jupyter), which provides the required NVIDIA CUDA drivers and adds the above community driven tools on top.
